# README

***Follow the `.pt` file access & evaluate code to use the `.pt` model***
    Folder name: **PT-Model-Evaluate**

***O/W, you can use `AutoModel` from `transformers` to load the model and test it on your own data***
    Folder name: **AutoModel-Evaluate**
    For AutoModel: from transformers additionally import 'logging as transformers_logging` and use it as 'transformers_logging.set_verbosity_error()' to avoid unnecessary warnings while downloading the custom model from hugging face (optional but, you'll get a clean output cell)
